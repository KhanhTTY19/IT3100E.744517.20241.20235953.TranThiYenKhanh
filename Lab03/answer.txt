Question:
- Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language? 
---> Java is a pass-by-value language

- After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain? 
---> Because java is a pass-by-value language, so we just send te copy of 2 object to function.

After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed? 
---> Because we change the data of the reference of the jungleDVD object.
